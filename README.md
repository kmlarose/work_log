# work_log

This console app allows you to track work tasks, how long they took, and notes. 

You can add new entries to the work log or look up previously saved entries. 

Search for entries by date (exact or date range), number of minutes spent, word search, or regex pattern search.
The results are displayed one page at a time, giving you the option to scroll through them, edit, or delete entries.
