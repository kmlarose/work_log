# PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS
# ====================
# Make sure your script runs without errors.
# Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.

# As a user of the script, I should be prompted with a menu to choose
# whether to add a new entry or lookup previous entries.

# As a user of the script, if I choose to enter a new work log,
# I should be able to provide a task name, a number of minutes spent working on it,
# and any additional notes I want to record.

# As a user of the script, if I choose to find a previous entry,
# I should be presented with four options:
# find by date
# find by time spent
# find by exact search
# find by pattern
# Note:
# When finding by date, I should be presented with a list of dates with entries
# and be able to choose one to see entries from.
# When finding by time spent, I should be allowed to enter the number of minutes a task took
# and be able to choose one to see entries from.
# When finding by an exact string, I should be allowed to enter a string
# and then be presented with entries containing that string in the task name or notes.
# When finding by a pattern, I should be allowed to enter a regular expression
# and then be presented with entries matching that pattern in their task name or notes.

# When displaying the entries, the entries should be displayed in a readable format with
# the date, task name, time spent, and notes information.

# Make sure your coding style complies with PEP 8.

# Before you submit your project for review,
# make sure you can check off all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist.
# The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements
# and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!

# EXTRA CREDIT
# ============
# Menu has a “quit” option to exit the program.
# Entries can be deleted and edited, letting user change the date,
# task name, time spent, and/or notes.
# Entries can be searched for and found based on a date range.
# For example between 01/01/2016 and 12/31/2016.
# Entries are displayed one at a time with the ability to page through records
# (previous/next/back).

# NOTE:
# To get an "Exceeds Expectations" grade for this project,
# you'll need to complete each of the items in this section.
# See the rubric in the "How You'll Be Graded" tab above for details on how you'll be graded.
# If you’re shooting for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade,
# it is recommended that you mention so in your submission notes.
# Passing grades are final. If you try for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade,
# but miss an item and receive a “Meets Expectations” grade, you won’t get a second chance.
# Exceptions can be made for items that have been misgraded in review.
